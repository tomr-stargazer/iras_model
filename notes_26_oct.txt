SAMPLING
========
radius sampling (i.e. which radii to sample from) : in the description problem_session .... use the transphere code
see problem_session.py

Do it in log space! 30 points should be sufficient, 60 is usually very good; start small and then double it, see if it makes a difference in your spectra.



convolution: straightforward enough!
just run convolv task
give it a map as an input
give it a beam size (fwhm)
and then give it an output
and then miriad is clever, so a map in jy/px input, the output maps shoudl come out in jy/beam

and it should also put into the header the beam size which is what you need if you want things on K s

imspect/imspec has an options=tb , giving it in brightness temp if you start in jy/beam

now for the offset thing...
need to make a decision as to where the emission is centered on
(jk coutens made the decision - it's on source A)

imspec region='arcsec,box(...)'

if you don't want to just do this easily... 
0,3,0,3
gives you a position 3'' off the peak of your emission distribution

STEPS:
1. convolve with the beam profile
2. extract the brightness temperature AT A POINT representing the telescope pointing. don't do any weird sums. 

The convolution creates a data product which represents "what brightness temperature would a telescope with this beam pattern see if pointed at a specific point in this map?" so extracting a spectrum from that point is the correct thing to do. 

miriad is very good at helping you keep track of the units, etc




VLA
===========

my own approach is to use the pipeline product until we run into something concerning.
Jes & Lars don't have a lot of direct 

"Why not run with it and see what happens?"

also seriously consider bringing John Tobin into the project...


FRACTIONATION
=============
Don't forget about 14n/15n ratios! There's a nice point in "high-J lines are more fractionated than low-J lines... confirm that!! Be able to make some statements about optical depth, etc."
Part of that comes in from... once you have the model running.



MAKE SURE TO SUBTRACT THE MODEL CONTINUUM SPECTRA BASELINE

quick trick: subtract the value of the first channel

do it after the convolution



==============

Sanity check: compare abundances against Schoeier et al once we get that far.
