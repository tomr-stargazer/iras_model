Jes's thoughts on dealing with hyperfine structure

1. Just sum all the intensity and compare integrated intensities. (This seemed reasonable to me, though sad.)

2. Or, "simulate" the hyperfine structure by taking the line you have and splitting its flux into 3 self-copied versions with flux ratios 1:5:3 (presumably, this would involve first dividing the central bit by .... nine? 1+5+3=9, then adding offset versions on the sides...)

3. My idea (which seems cumbersome) is to assume the h13cn 1-0 and hcn 1-0 are basically equivalent; simulate hcn 1-0 and then use those fluxes (with h13cn abundances) directly.. Jes didn't seem to care one way or the ohter for that.
